# HEMOSTASIS

**Protecting vascular integrity**

>Hemostasis is a process to prevent and stop bleeding, meaning to keep blood within a damaged blood vessel (the opposite of hemostasis is hemorrhage). It is the first stage of wound healing. This involves coagulation, blood changing from a liquid to a gel.

TOPICS WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED IN THIS DOCUMENT:

1. [ ] Platelets
2. [ ] Hemostasis steps
3. [ ] Proteins and cofactors involved in blood coagulation and clot dissolution
4. [ ] Fibrinolytic phase of hemostasis
5. [ ] Anticoagulants
6. [ ] Clinical point: Protein C deficiency

## PLATELETS
- Platelets are not true cells, they are the fragments of cells. 
- They have a very small diameter; almost 1/3 the diameter of red blood cells. 
- Just like RBC's they dont have a nucleus
- Platelets originate as fragments of precursors called megakaryocytes.
- At rest these platelets have a disk shape.
- Platelet concentration= 150,000 to 450,000 per $\mu$ L of blood.
- Mean life span= 7-10 days

### PLATELET FUNCTIONS

Platelets posses different functional properties.

 They exert an important function in coagulation / clotting: Platelets form a temporary seal when a blood vessel breaks. 
 
 Platelets also actively participate in the coagulation cascade: they are the site of binding of different coagulation factors.
 
 > Platelets are the origin of different coagulation factors but also the site of their binding during their activation. 

#### How does the platelet function?

Basically, at rest it has a round or disk shape. On its surface are various receptors all connected to a G protein signalling mechanism which subsequently controls the intracellular second messenger.

This leads to the platelet becoming activated and concomitantly losing its round shape to become shrivelled and irregular. 

#### Formation of Platelets

The formation of platelets is divided into 2 parts.

In the first part, we have what is known as *Megakaryopoiesis*
