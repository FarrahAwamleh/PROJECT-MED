# HEMOSTASIS

**Protecting vascular integrity**

>Hemostasis is a process to prevent and stop bleeding, meaning to keep blood within a damaged blood vessel (the opposite of hemostasis is hemorrhage). It is the first stage of wound healing. This involves coagulation, blood changing from a liquid to a gel.

TOPICS WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED IN THIS DOCUMENT:

1. [ ] Platelets
2. [ ] Hemostasis steps
3. [ ] Proteins and cofactors involved in blood coagulation and clot dissolution
4. [ ] Fibrinolytic phase of hemostasis
5. [ ] Anticoagulants
6. [ ] Clinical point: Protein C deficiency

## PLATELETS
- Platelets are not true cells, they are the fragments of cells. 
- They have a very small diameter; almost 1/3 the diameter of red blood cells. 
- Just like RBC's they dont have a nucleus
- Platelets originate as fragments of precursors called megakaryocytes.
- At rest these platelets have a disk shape.
- Platelet concentration= 150,000 to 450,000 per $\mu$ L of blood.
- Mean life span= 7-10 days

### PLATELET FUNCTIONS

Platelets posses different functional properties.

 They exert an important function in coagulation / clotting: Platelets form a temporary seal when a blood vessel breaks. 
 
 Platelets also actively participate in the coagulation cascade: they are the site of binding of different coagulation factors.
 
 > Platelets are the origin of different coagulation factors but also the site of their binding during their activation. 

#### How does the platelet function?

Basically, at rest it has a round or disk shape. On its surface are various receptors all connected to a G protein signalling mechanism which subsequently controls the intracellular second messenger.

This leads to the platelet becoming activated and concomitantly losing its round shape to become shrivelled and irregular. 

#### Formation of Platelets

The formation of platelets is divided into 2 parts.

In the first part, we have what is known as *Megakaryopoiesis*
This developmental phase involves different steps. 

Among them, there is the repeated mitosis of megakaryocytes in the early maturation stage. This occurs without cytokinesis which means there is nucleus division but not of the cell. Thus, gradually the cell becomes enlarged as it develops in the following manner.

```

2. *Thrombopoiesis*:
In this phase, the final mature platelet is formed.
