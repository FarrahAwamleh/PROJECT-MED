<h1 id="hemostasis">HEMOSTASIS</h1>
<p><strong>Protecting vascular integrity</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hemostasis is a process to prevent and stop bleeding, meaning to keep blood within a damaged blood vessel (the opposite of hemostasis is hemorrhage). It is the first stage of wound healing. This involves coagulation, blood changing from a liquid to a gel.</p>

<h2 id="platelets">PLATELETS</h2>
<ul>
<li>Platelets are not true cells, they are the fragments of cells.</li>
<li>They have a very small diameter; almost 1/3 the diameter of red blood cells.</li>
<li>Just like RBC’s they dont have a nucleus</li>
<li>Platelets originate as fragments of precursors called megakaryocytes.</li>
<li>At rest these platelets have a disk shape.</li>
<li>Platelet concentration= 150,000 to 450,000 per <span class="katex--inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>μ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mu</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.625em; vertical-align: -0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">μ</span></span></span></span></span> L of blood.</li>

<h3 id="platelet-functions">PLATELET FUNCTIONS</h3>
<p>Platelets posses different functional properties.</p>
<p>They exert an important function in coagulation / clotting: Platelets form a temporary seal when a blood vessel breaks.</p>
<p>Platelets also actively participate in the coagulation cascade: they are the site of binding of different coagulation factors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Platelets are the origin of different coagulation factors but also the site of their binding during their activation.</p>

<h4 id="how-does-the-platelet-function">How does the platelet function?</h4>
<p>Basically, at rest it has a round or disk shape. On its surface are various receptors all connected to a G protein signalling mechanism which subsequently controls the intracellular second messenger.</p>
<p>This leads to the platelet becoming activated and concomitantly losing its round shape to become shrivelled and irregular.</p>
<h4 id="formation-of-platelets">Formation of Platelets</h4>
<p>The formation of platelets is divided into 2 parts.</p>
<p>In the first part, we have what is known as <strong>Megakaryopoiesis</strong></p>
